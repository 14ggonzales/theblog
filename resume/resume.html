	<h3>

Lockma, located in the vibrant Richmond district of San Francisco, offers a Breakfast Sandwich to start your day off on the right foot. Priced at $16, this sandwich is a steal for its explosion of flavors and textures. It's more than just a meal—it's a symphony of flavors and textures that will awaken your senses and fuel your day.

Imagine sinking your teeth into a warm, toasted bun filled with two fluffy scrambled eggs infused with tangy feta cheese. Each bite is a burst of rich, savory goodness, complemented by the refreshing crunch of fresh arugula and juicy tomatoes. The house sauce adds a zesty kick, tying all the flavors together in perfect harmony.

But what truly sets this sandwich apart is the addition of the crispy potatoes on the side—golden and crispy, they provide the perfect accompaniment to this already indulgent meal. Not only is this Breakfast Sandwich delicious, but it's also incredibly filling. You'll find that it keeps you satisfied and energized until lunchtime, making it the perfect choice for a busy day ahead.
