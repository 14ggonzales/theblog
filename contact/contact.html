	<h3>

		Devils teeth's Breakfast Sandwich is a vegan and vegetarian delight, offering a flavorful and satisfying option for those with dietary preferences. Priced at a reasonable $8, this sandwich is not only budget-friendly but also ranks top-tier in terms of taste and fulfillment.
		The star of the sandwich is the plant-based egg, which provides a protein-packed base that rivals its traditional counterpart. The addition of vegan American cheese adds a creamy richness, while the herb aioli lends a burst of flavor that elevates the sandwich to gourmet status.
		For those looking to add more substance, Rad Radish offers tempeh bacon or Beyond Sausage as optional additions. These meat alternatives are not only delicious but also add a savory depth that complements the other ingredients perfectly.
		Rad Radish's commitment to accommodating dietary preferences is evident in their willingness to offer substitutions for eggs or meat whenever possible. This dedication to inclusivity sets Devils Teeth apart and makes it a standout choice for those seeking a delicious and fulfilling breakfast option.
